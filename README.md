# TinyAudio

TinyAudio is a cross-platform audio output library. It's main goal to provide unified access to
a default sound output device of your operating system as easy as possible, covering as many platforms
such as PC (Windows, Linux, macOS), Mobile Devices (Android, iOS), and WebAssembly.

## What this crate can do

The crate just takes the data you've prepared and sends it to a default operating system's sound output
device. It uses floating-point audio samples and converts them to closest supported platform-dependent
format automatically. Use it, if you need to play your audio samples as easy as possible.

## What this crate cannot do

It does not load any sound formats, it doesn't apply any digital signal processing (DSP) techniques, it
doesn't do audio spatialization and so on. Also the crate does not support device enumeration, device
selection, querying of supported formats, input capturing (i.e. from microphone).

## Supported platforms

| Windows | Linux | macOS | WebAssembly | Android | iOS |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|---------|-----|
| âœ…       | ðŸš§    | ðŸš§    | ðŸš§          | ðŸš§      | ðŸš§  |

## How it works

The crate internally creates an audio output context and uses a user-defined callback to supply the device
with samples to play. The callback will be called periodically to generate new data; it will be called util
the device instance is "alive". In other words this crate performs simplest audio streaming.

## Examples

The crate is very easy to use, here's a few examples that will help you to start using it right away.

### Initialization

A simplest possible example that shows how to initialize an output device.

```rust,no_run
# use tinyaudio::prelude::*;
let _device = run_output_device(
    OutputDeviceParameters {
        channels_count: 2,
        sample_rate: 44100,
        channel_sample_count: 4100,
    },
    move |_| {
        // Output silence
    },
)
.unwrap();

std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1));
```

### Playing a sine wave

A simple example that plays a sine wave of 440 Hz looks like so:

```rust,no_run
# use tinyaudio::prelude::*;
let params = OutputDeviceParameters {
    channels_count: 2,
    sample_rate: 44100,
    channel_sample_count: 4100,
};

let _device = run_output_device(params, {
    let mut clock = 0f32;
    move |data| {
        for samples in data.chunks_mut(params.channels_count) {
            clock = (clock + 1.0) % params.sample_rate as f32;
            let value =
                (clock * 440.0 * 2.0 * std::f32::consts::PI / params.sample_rate as f32).sin();
            for sample in samples {
                *sample = value;
            }
        }
    }
})
.unwrap();

std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(5));
```
